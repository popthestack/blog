# Things About Ryan

I love books. I love the internet and devices that connect to it, specifically the iPhone.
I speak Spanish. I'm a [lindy hopper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAAAV7BB1HU).
I enjoy camping, fly fishing, hiking, and rock climbing. The latter of those outdoor activities
is the only one to increase since moving to New York City. I pretend to be a photographer, but
don't worry, you won't be fooled. I love traveling. I'm a [Mormon](http://mormon.org/).

I work as a web developer in New York City. I grew up in Salt Lake City. I once lived in Cincinnati. I apparently like living in cities with four syllable names.

I used to write software for Windows. Now I spend my days writing PHP. My website is baked with [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/).
