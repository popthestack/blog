Today.

<blockquote>Dear Hallmark,

I have [a card idea] for you today.

A drawing of a bashful puppy with a comical bandage around his fluffy jaw. Inside text: It kills me that you're afraid of me now.

Maybe someone at your offices can help me [with this]? It doesn't seem like enough.

I wish there was a card that could fix things.

I'm sorry.
