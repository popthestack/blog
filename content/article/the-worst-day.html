<p>Today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Hallmark,</p>
<p>I have [a card idea] for you today.</p>
<p>A drawing of a bashful puppy with a comical bandage around his fluffy jaw. Inside text: It kills me that you&#8217;re afraid of me now.</p>
<p>Maybe someone at your offices can help me [with this]? It doesn&#8217;t seem like enough.</p>
<p>I wish there was a card that could fix things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
