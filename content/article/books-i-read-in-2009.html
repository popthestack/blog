*Conclusions:*
I love love love audio books. I spend a lot of time on the subway and walking around the city. I’ve spent hours on the couch playing tetris on my phone while listening to books.

I can’t help but read multiple books at once. I intend to finish them, I really do. When I’m home, though, I tend to spend all my time on the computer so it’s harder to finish paper (or electronic) books.
