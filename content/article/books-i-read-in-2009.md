  comment = "Hey, I read mistborn just the other month! Fun stuff.\n\nIn linguistic circles, Elements of Style is widely disparaged. I hear good things about \"Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace\" by Joseph William, though.\n\nAnna Karenina's awesome. You ought to love it."

  comment = "You didn't like The Alchemist? Really? I absolutely loved it. I bought it in Spanish (was originally written in Spanish) because I liked it so much (though I have to start it, surprise surprise).\n\nThanks for the suggestions, both of you!"

<strong>Conclusions:</strong>  
I love love love audio books. I spend a lot of time on the subway and walking around the city. I've spent hours on the couch playing tetris on my phone while listening to books.

I can't help but read multiple books at once. I intend to finish them, I really do. When I'm home, though, I tend to spend all my time on the computer so it's harder to finish paper (or electronic) books.
