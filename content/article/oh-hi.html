It’s been a while.

In the last month I..

* Went to a dance event in Boston
* Turned down two job offers
* Accepted a 3rd offer and started a new job
* Went to Disney World for my birthday (I am now 28)

I’m really excited to be doing something new for work. I’ll talk about it when we launch the new website.

Disney World was awesome and I wish I was still there.
