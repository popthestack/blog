It's not as cold as winter.

It's pretty.

It's not as hot as summer.

Pumpkins.

Food and treats made with pumpkins.

No really. Jamba Juice's Pumpkin Smash Smoothie. 16 Handles' Pumpkin frozen yogurt. Pumpkin bread. Pumpkin cookies. Chocolate chip pumpkin cookies. Pumpkin bread with cream cheese frosting. Pumpkin creme brulee\*.

\* Haven't tried it yet, but I fully intend to.
