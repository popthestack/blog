It's been a while.

In the last month I...

<ul class="normal">
	<li>Went to a dance event in Boston</li>
	<li>Turned down two job offers</li>
	<li>Accepted a 3rd offer and started a new job</li>
	<li>Went to Disney World for my birthday (I am now 28)</li>
</ul>

I'm really excited to be doing something new for work. I'll talk about it when we launch the new website.

Disney World was awesome and I wish I was still there.
